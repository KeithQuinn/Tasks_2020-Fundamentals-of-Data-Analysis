# Tasks_2020-Fundamentals-of-Data-Analysis
This repository includes all files and details that make up the 2020 Fundamentals of Data Analysis Tasks. There are a total of 4 tasks to be complete during the semester;

- Task 1: counts
- Task 2: dicerolls
- Task 3:
- Task 4:

Each of the tasks has different challenges and all workings will be documented in the jupyter notebook Tasks_2020 Fundamentals of Data Analysis.ipynb.

This README includes a high level overview of the repository but for full detail including the code refer to the aforementioned ipynb jupyter notebook.

## Task 1_counts

High level detail of the breakdown of Task 1, for full detail refer to the Tasks_2020 Fundamentals of Data Analysis.ipynb file within this repository.

<br>

### 1.1 Instructions

Task instructions included here.

<br>

### 1.2 Research

First thoughts on the task, the approach to be taken to complete the task and some research into the proposed approach provided.

<br>

### 1.3 Development

Code written to cover the following 4 points;

- Create a list of elements.
- Create an empty dictionary.
- Dictionary will be populated from the list.
- Print the list and dictionary.

<br>

### 1.4 Creating a Function

Using the for loop developed in the development section a function is created here.
