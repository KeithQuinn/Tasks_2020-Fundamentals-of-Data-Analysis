# Tasks_2020-Fundamentals-of-Data-Analysis
This repository includes all files and details that make up the 2020 Fundamentals of Data Analysis Tasks. There are a total of 4 tasks to be complete during the semester;

- Task 1: counts
- Task 2: dicerolls
- Task 3:
- Task 4:

Each of the tasks has different challenges and all workings will be documented in the jupyter notebook Tasks_2020 Fundamentals of Data Analysis.ipynb.

This README includes a high level overview of the repository but for full detail including the code refer to the aforementioned Tasks_2020 Fundamentals of Data Analysis.ipynb. jupyter notebook available within this repository.

## Task 1_counts

High level detail of the breakdown of Task 1 is provided, for full detail refer to the Tasks_2020 Fundamentals of Data Analysis.ipynb file within this repository.

<br>

### 1.1 Instructions

Task instructions included here.

<br>

### 1.2 Research

First thoughts on the task, the approach to be taken to complete the task and some research into the proposed approach provided.

<br>

### 1.3 Development

Code written to cover the following 4 points;

- Create a list of elements.
- Create an empty dictionary.
- Dictionary will be populated from the list.
- Print the list and dictionary.

<br>

### 1.4 Creating a Function

Using the for loop developed in the development section a function is created here.

<br>

### 1.5 Learnings

The learnings achieved through the completion of task 1 is documented here.

## Task 2_dicerolls

High level detail of the breakdown of Task 2 is provided, for full detail refer to the Tasks_2020 Fundamentals of Data Analysis.ipynb file within this repository.

<br>

### 2.1 Instructions

Task instructions included here.

<br>

### 2.2 Research

The task is broken down into 3 parts. Some research into the best approach to complete the three parts is included.

- Part 1) Roll the dice.
- Part 2) Include a plotting element within the function.
- Part 3) Create and populate the dictionary.

<br>

### 2.3 Development

The code is discussed and how the three parts were included in the function.

<br>

#### 2.3.1 Part 1) Roll the dice.

Part 1 discussed.

<br>

#### 2.3.2 Part 2) Include a plotting element within the function.

Part 2 discussed.

<br>

#### 2.3.3 Part 3) Create and populate the dictionary.

Part 3 discussed.

<br>

### 2.4 Learnings
The learnings achieved through the completion of task 2 is documented here.

## Task 3_binomial

High level detail of the breakdown of Task 3 is provided, for full detail refer to the Tasks_2020 Fundamentals of Data Analysis.ipynb file within this repository.

<br>

### 3.1 Instructions

Task instructions included here.

<br>

### 3.2 Research

Some research completed into binomial distributions is provided.

<br>

### 3.3 Development
The three parameters for np.random.binomial(n, p, size) are discussed and some discussion with reference to the task instructions.

- 'n' is the number of trials (how many times the coin will be flipped)
- 'p' is the probability (1/2 or 50% for a coin toss)
- 'size' is the number of repeated trials (number of times the trials above is repeated)

<br>

### 3.4 Learnings
The learnings achieved through the completion of task 3 is documented here.
