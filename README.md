## Tasks_2020-Fundamentals-of-Data-Analysis
Four tasks were received throughout the semester as part of the module 'Fundamentals of Data Analysis 2020'. All four are completed included in this repository. The four tasks include;

- Task 1_counts
- Task 2_dicerolls
- Task 3_binomial
- Task 4_Simpson's paradox

### Task 1_counts
For task one, a function was created to count the number of elements in a list and populate a dictionary with the results.

### Task 2_dicerolls
For task two, code was developed to simulate the number of dice (k) and the number of times (n) the dice were rolled. The code included a function which simulated randomly rolling (k) dice (n) times, keeping track of each total face value. It then returned a dictionary with the number of times each possible total face value occurred and also plotted the results.

### Task 3_binomial
Using the numpy.random.binomial function, coin flipping was simulated. Code was developed to simulate flipping a coin 1,000 times. Interestingly, when the coin was flipped 1,000 times then the number of heads was well approximated by a bell-shaped curve. A plot is provided for demonstration.

### Task 4_Simpsons_Paradox
Simpsonâ€™s paradox occurs when trends that appear when a dataset is separated into groups reverse when the data are aggregated. It has been proven that with data exhibiting Simpson's paradox it's possible to prove opposite arguments using this same data. In the code above there are 4 positively trending data sets that when aggregated result in a negative trend.
